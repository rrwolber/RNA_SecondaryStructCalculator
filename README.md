# RNA_SecondaryStructCalculator

Bioinformatics script mapping potential base interactions within RNA on the HIV virus in order to find areas which have the greatest complexity of RNA.

Separate scripts use turtle to map base interactions used in scoring process in order to visualize RNA structuring. Images attached.
